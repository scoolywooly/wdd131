                    I hail from southern Missouri, a small town called West Plains. in the middle of the region locally
                    known as the Ozarks just above the "South," and right below the majority of the Midwest.
                    I wasn't born there, but I spent most of my life there being raised as a homeschooler kid by my
                    Mother
                    and Father. I have a dog named Dex and a burning bright testimony of Jesus Christ our Savior and
                    Redeemer.
                    The general summary of most of my hobbies is: Writing, Reading, Drawing (pretty much anything
                    creative
                    or artsy), Pixel art, Programming, *some* video games like Hollow Knight or Minecraft, Comics,
                    Origami,
                    and Chess (though I'm not very good at it).

                    The United States of America (USA), primarily located in North America, is a federation of 50
                    states, a
                    federal district, and 326 Indian reservations. It's the world's third-largest by land area and
                    population. The USA began as 13 British colonies and declared independence on July 4, 1776. In 1783,
                    it
                    became the first country to gain independence from a European power. The first constitution was
                    adopted
                    in 1788, and is one of the first nations to outright encourage freedom of religion, freedom of the
                    published thought, and abolish slavery. The USA is known for its diverse population and geography.
